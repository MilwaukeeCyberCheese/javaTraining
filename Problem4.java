/*
 * Alice travels a lot for her work. Each time she travels, she visits a single
 * city before returning home.
 * Someone recently asked her “how many different cities have you visited for
 * work?” Thankfully Alice has kept a log of her trips. Help Alice figure out
 * the number of cities she has visited at least once.
 * 
 * Input
 * The first line of input contains a single positive integer T <= 50 indicating the
 * number of test cases. The first line of each test case also contains a single
 * positive integer indicating the number of work trips Alice has taken so far.
 * The following lines describe these trips. The nth such line simply contains
 * the name of the city Alice visited on her nth trip.
 * 
 * Alice’s work only sends her to cities with simple names: city names only
 * contain lowercase letters, have at least one letter, and do not contain
 * spaces.
 * 
 * The number of trips is at most 100 and no city name contains more than 20
 * characters.
 * 
 * Output
 * For each test case, simply output a single line containing a single integer
 * that is the number of distinct cities that Alice has visited on her work
 * trips.

/*
 * Hints:
 * 
 * 1. Use a linked list to keep track of the cities Alice has visited so far.
 * 2. Use the Scanner class to read the input.
