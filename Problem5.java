/*
 * Given a base b and two non-negative base-b integers p and m, compute p mod m
 * and print the result as a base b integer.
 * p mod m is defined as the smallest non-negative integer k such that p = am + k for some integer a.
 * 
 * Input
 * Input consists of a number of cases (at most 1000). Each case is represented
 * by a line containing three non-negative integers. 
 * The first, b, is a base-10 number between 2 and 10. 
 * The second, p, contains up to 1000 digits between 0 and b-1. 
 * The third, m, contains up to 9 digits between 0 and b-1. 
 * The last case is followed by a line containing 0.
 * 
 * Output
 * For each test case, print a line giving p mod m
 * as a base-b
 * integer.

 /*
  * HINTS:
    * 1. You can use the BigInteger class to represent arbitrarily large integers.
    * 2. You can use the Scanner class to read input from a file.
