/*
 * Problem 2
 * 
 * Mr. Reed's wants an easy way to keep track of all of the students and their grades in his class, as well as a quick way to get their average grade for the year.  
 * 
 * Create the Student class so that we can have a Student object for everyone in the class, with functions that will return their name and Letter Grade
 * 
 * Grading Rubric:
 * 90 <= A <= 100
 * 80 <= B < 90
 * 70 <= C < 80
 * 60 <= D < 70
 * 0 <= F < 60
